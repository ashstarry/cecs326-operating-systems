/*
* PROGRAM: lab5_b.c 
*
* Usage: 
* ./lab5_b.c <N-number-of-children> <T-sleep-time>
*
* argv limitations:
* 1 <= N < 20
* 0 <= T < 50
*
* This is a parent program which calls the fork()
* system call to create N children, each child process
* uses the execl call to call the child.out program
* passing the child number (k) and sleep time as arguments. 
* For each forked child the parent prints the forked child's PID.
*
* After the 3 child processes are iniated, the parent process
* waits for each child to complete and as they each complete
* prints the child PID and return value (status)
*
